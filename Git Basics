`git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git or git clone https://github.com/user-name/repository-name.git`

`git push origin main`

`git add .`

`git commit -m “A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different”`

The basic Git syntax is `program | action | destination`.

For example,
* `git add .` is read as `git | add | .`, where the period represents everything in the current directory;
* `git commit -m “message”` is read as `git | commit -m | “message”`; and
* `git status` is read as `git | status | (no destination)`.


To get an app into git and deploy to heroku:
`git init`

`git add .`

`git commit -m “Initial commit”`
